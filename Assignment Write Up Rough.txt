ChatBot Assignment Write-Up1.	Go to GitHub and copy the link2.	Import the project into Eclipse3.	Instantiate the fields _face, _name, and _count in the class constructor4.	Write a getter method that returns an object of type Baemoji5.	Write a getter and setter method for the variable _userNameBuilding the Parser1.	The idea is to build a method that takes as its input a String that the user passes to the program, and search it for keywords and then generate a response based on words contained in the user’s input2.	Write a method heading with appropriate parameter(s) 3.	Using conditional statements, write a series of statements that search for at least 8 different keywordsa.	One needs to search for “mom”, “dad”, “sister” or “brother”b.	One needs to search for “joke” and return a joker method (see part 2)
c.	One MUST be introduction() and prompt user to enter their name4.	For each corresponding keyword, be sure to write a method that returns an appropriate response and return it within your parserBuilding the Randomizer1.	The parser needs a default response to reply to the user with, but we don’t want it to return the same string every single time2.	Write a method that returns a string3.	In the body of the method, use the Math.random() which returns a decimal between 0 and .99 at random to write an equation that would randomly select 1 of at least 5 generic responses and returns the corresponding string4.	Return this method in the last conditional of the parsing method5.	Repeat steps 1-4 to randomize a return of one line jokes
